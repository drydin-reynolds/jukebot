# JukeBot

JukeBot is a social media platform for music lovers. Inspired by the jukeboxes of the mid 20th century and the retrofuturism movement of the same era, it uses AI to allow users to meet others who share their tastes and discover new music they may be interested in.

JukeBot is currently a work in progress. You can follow the development on this page, or preview the platform [here](https://jukebot.club/).
